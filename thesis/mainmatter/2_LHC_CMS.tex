\chapter[The CMS at the LHC]{The CMS at the LHC}

This chapter will provide an overview about the European Organization for Nuclear Research, known by its acronym CERN (Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire), the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment. It will also go through the discovery of the Higgs boson at the LHC in 2012 by the CMS collaboration \cite{CMS:2012qbp}.

\section{The Large Hadron Collider at CERN}

The European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) is an intergovernmental organization composed of 23 member states that operates the world's largest particle physics laboratory. Established in 1954, CERN is situated on the Franco-Swiss border near Geneva, Switzerland, and is one of the largest and most influential research organizations in particle physics. The missions of CERN include world-class research in fundamental physics, sustainable and environmentally responsible accelerator facilities, global collaboration in science and technology advancement and the education and engagement of future scientists, engineers and the broader public.

CERN has been home to many accelerators, including the original linear accelerator \linebreak LINAC 1 (in operation from 1959 until 1992), the LINAC 2 (1978 - 2018), the Super Proton-Antiproton Synchrotron (S$p\bar{p}$S) (1981-1991), the Large Electron-Positron Collider (LEP) (1989-2000), and the current Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which was constructed between 1998 and 2008 and achieved its first collisions in 2010.

During its nearly 70-year history since its creation, many important achievements in particle physics have been made through experiments at CERN, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0em}
    \item The discovery of neutral currents by studying neutrinos produced by the PS/SPS neutrino beam interacting in the Gargamelle bubble chamber in 1973 \cite{GargamelleNeutrino:1973jyy}.
    \item The discovery of the $W$ and $Z$ bosons in the UA1 and UA2 experiments in 1983 \cite{UA1:1983crd, UA2:1983tsx}.
    \item The determination of the number of light neutrino families at LEP in 1989 \cite{ALEPH:1989kcj}.
    \item The discovery of direct CP violation in the NA48 experiment in 1999 \cite{NA48:1999szy}.
    \item The discovery of the Higgs boson at LHC by the CMS and ATLAS collaborations in 2012 \cite{CMS:2012qbp,ATLAS:2012yve}.
\end{itemize}
