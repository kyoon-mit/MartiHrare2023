\chapter[Analysis]{Analysis}

This chapter is the central cornerstone of this dissertation. In it, we will discuss the analysis conducted, starting with a general overview, followed by an explanation of the samples, triggers, and object definitions. We will then discuss the corrections made to the data and simulations to enhance the analysis results. We will also cover the various criteria utilized in event selection and how the signal and background have been modeled. Ultimately, we will present the expected limits for each channel. The chapter concludes by addressing the subsequent steps required prior to data unblinding and the attainment of the final experimental measurement.
