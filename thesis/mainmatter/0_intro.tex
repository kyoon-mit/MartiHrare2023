\chapter*{Introduction}

Since ancient times, humanity has endeavored to comprehend and model the world. In this pursuit, we developed the mathematical language, the foundation for any physical theory aiming to predict the result of a particular process. These physical theories have been refined, expanded, and perfected over the years. Today, there is an underlying theory seeking to predict and understand nearly every physical process.

Examples of such theories include Quantum Mechanics (QM) and the Standard Model of Particle Physics (SM), the latter aiming to explain the behavioiur of the most fundamental particles that constitute all matter. However, at the end of the nineteenth century, some prestigious scientists believed that all known physical theories were sufficient to describe nature. As Lord Kelvin famously stated at the beginning of the twentieth century:

        \emph{``There is nothing new to be discovered in physics now. All that remains is more and more precise measurement.''}\\
        \hfill{}-- Lord Kelvin (1901)\\
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}
As we know today, he could not have been more wrong, as the last century has been the most scientifically successful in all of history.

Quantum Mechanics, born in the early decades of the last century, aimed to explain the wave-particle duality for light, among other observed and unexplained phenomena. Scientists like Max Planck, Albert Einstein, Erwin Schr√∂dinger and Paul Dirac, along with many other brilliant minds, developed a theory capable of explaining the intricacies of the interaction between particles of light, photons, and matter. Quantum Mechanics was subsequently followed by Quantum Field Theory (QFT) when the idea of quantizing the electromagnetic field emerged in the late 1920s. QFT combined three major themes of modern physics: quantum theory, the field concept, and the principle of relativity. This set of theories gave rise to quantum electrodynamics (QED) in the 1950s.
